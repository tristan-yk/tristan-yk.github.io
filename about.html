                <p class="lede">A snapshot of some things I've done and some things I like.</p>
                <p class="lede">Thus far, I've had the opportunity to represent Canada at the 2024 European Physics Olympiad, winning a bronze medal, and at the European Space Agency's 2024 CanSat event. This year, I will be representing the University of Waterloo at the Ontario Engineering Competition in the Senior Design category.</p>

                        <h3>Robotics and Controls</h3>
                        <p class="card-preview">My first introduction to controls was through Waterloo Rocketry. I had the privilege of being mentored by a Master's student on the development of a controller for a canard roll control system. I fell in love with the field then and have not looked back since.</p>
                        <p class="card-detail">Recently, I've been integrating the PiPER robot arm from AgileX with the ZeroKey ultrasonic positioning system to make a robotic camera mount that can perform smooth tracking motions while the arm itself is mounted to a custom robot chassis. I am working with Hacksmith Industries to develop this into a fully functional camera bot and teleoperable cobot.</p>
                        <p class="card-detail">Outside of work, I've designed a custom STM32 Nucleo shield as a sensor hub to develop an EKF for an Inertial Navigation System. I'm hoping to refine this device into an effective and accurate drone altimeter.</p>
                        <p class="card-detail">I have dreamed up a couple more (rather ambitious) robotics and controls projects that I want to take on during my undergrad, but those shall remain secrets for now.</p>

                        <h3>Physics and Math</h3>
                        <p class="card-preview">These two subjects defined much of my identity throughout my teenage years. I was a member of Physics Team Canada in 2024 and won a bronze medal at the European Physics Olympiad. I also had my share of success in math contests including competing in the Canadian Math Olympiad twice and winning the Canadian Senior Mathematics Contest.</p>
                        <p class="card-detail">I've worked hard to maintain my involvement with the Olympiad community, even after graduating. These days, I'm helping run the Canadian Physics Olympiad Program by organizing alumni hosted lectures at camp, composing team selection questions, and, most recently, founding the Canadian Junior Physics Olympiad in order to create opportunities for guidance and mentorship.</p>
                        <p class="card-detail">I'm also currently the co-director of the <a href="https://opho.physoly.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Online Physics Olympiad</a>, an international physics contest with over 3000 contestants annually. I love composing creative and unique physics problems and this involvement allows me to give back to a community that has shaped me into who I am today.</p>

                        <h3>Electronics</h3>
                        <p class="card-preview">I have designed several custom PCBs and wired together some non-trivial systems. The highlights of my electronics work certainly include the <a href="https://github.com/tristan-yk/Aroma" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom HMI board</a> I made for my friend's essential oil diffuser and the hacked together electrical system of Hacksmith's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY5D-x-vRBs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fallout Pip-Boy</a>.</p>
                        <p class="card-detail">As far as medium power electronics system I've worked on, I designed the circuitry the autonomous robot chassis to include an emergency stop, charging circuit, and other safeguards. Going forward, I'd like to gain more board design experience and also learn about power electronics and high frequency and wireless signals.</p>

                        <h3>Rocketry</h3>
                        <p class="card-preview">My interest in rocketry and related fields has been around as long as I have been drawn toward engineering. I have been an avid member of Waterloo Rocketry since beginning university. Before that, I won a trip to the European Space Agency through the CanSat competition.</p>
                        <p class="card-detail">I am currently working on building <a href="https://github.com/waterloo-rocketry/closedrocket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ClosedRocket</a>, a sounding rocket simulation software capable of handling closed loop aerodynamic control in order to implement a canard based roll control system on Waterloo Rocketry's <em>Polaris</em> rocket.</p>

                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>Sports</h3>
                        <p class="card-preview">As an over-energetic child, I have always been super into sports and played anything and everything I was able to growing up. The two sports that have stood the test of time for me are skiing and hockey.</p>
                        <p class="card-detail">I started skating when I was two and played every hockey position (including goalie) at a respectable level. Throughout my later childhood I had to choose between the two and unfortunately stepped away from skiing after covid History. I got back into it at the end of high school after hanging up my skates due to repeated concussions.</p>
                        <p class="card-detail">Nowadays I ski pretty often (however often I can get up to Whistler, that is) and have recently taken up indoor bouldering and intramural ultimate.</p>

                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                        <p class="card-preview">Unsurprisingly, I've picked up a few of the nerdier hobbies over the years. Cubing has always been a fairweather interest of mine and at one point I got my personal best down to 13.9 seconds. I've always favoured the 3x3x3 and found it hard to move onto the larger cubes but I would like to try some day.</p>
                        <p class="card-detail">During covid I played a lot of chess instead of attending my online classes. I don't play much anymore but I am always open to a game. I also got into scrabble for a bit but I found the amount of memorization required to be proficient at the game a bit of a turnoff.</p>
                        <p class="card-detail">My most recent escape has been poker (No Limit Hold'em, of course). I think NLH is a fun balance between strategy, guesswork, and luck and I do think that even playing microstakes makes the game more exciting. I'm by no means a winning player at any decent table—I recall playing heads up against a pro once and I didn't win a single hand at showdown—and I hope I am wise enough not to get into real poker.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>Travel</h3>
                        <p class="card-preview">Over the last couple years I've had the privilege to travel abroad a lot and it has really changed my perspective on the world. My first time outside of North America was my graduation trip to Europe, hastily cobbled together by me and my friends after we got invited to tour the European Space Agency. We spent about a month having a great time running all over Western Europe before I headed off to the European Physics Olympiad in Georgia.</p>
                        <p class="card-detail">At the end of 2025 I went on vacation to Taiwan and Macau with my family and it was great to be exposed to proper asian culture for the first time. The food was absolutely delicious (I mostly consumed bubble tea) and it makes me all the more sad at the lack of proper asian cuisine in Waterloo.</p>
                        <p class="card-detail">Travelling also instills a fire in me to learn languages. When I travelled to Europe I really regretted not taking French more seriously and I felt much the same about Mandarin when I travelled to Taiwan. I am now trying to learn Mandarin again after I dropped it back in high school.</p>

                        <h3>Entertainment</h3>
                        <p class="card-preview">Though my attention span has been ruined by short form content these days, there are a few pieces of media that I have really enjoyed, have inspired a great deal of reflection, or taught me something invaluable.</p>
                        <p class="card-detail">In no particular order, I would strongly recommend (as in I wish I could re-experience for the first time) the following:</p>
