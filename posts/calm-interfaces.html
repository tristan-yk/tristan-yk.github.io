  <p class="lede">Calm interfaces signal priority, not urgency. They leave room for breathing.</p>

  <h2>Starts With Tone</h2>
  <p>Pick one accent and stick to it. Let text do most of the communication; color is for emphasis, not the main language.</p>

  <h3>Edges and Borders</h3>
  <p>Use borders sparingly. A single line with generous padding does more than multiple boxes nested inside each other.</p>

  <h2>Motion</h2>
  <p>Animations should hint at relationships. A sidebar sliding over the content tells you where it came from and where it will return.</p>

  <h2>Copy</h2>
  <p>Short labels reduce clutter. If a tooltip is required to understand a control, reconsider the control.</p>

  <h2>Checklist I Use</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Two weights of text (regular + semibold) cover 90% of cases.</li>
    <li>Line height above 1.6 for anything longer than a paragraph.</li>
    <li>One focal point per screen—avoid competing highlights.</li>
  </ul>
