  <p class="lede">With how popular vibe coding and general generative AI usage has become over the last few months, I want to share my own perspective on how LLMs have impacted my life and my perspective on it.</p>

  <h2>The Evolution of Skills</h2>
  <p>As my reliance on LLMs continuously increases, I worry that my ability to function and learn on my own is being erased. I'm not worried about losing my ability to think or problem solve yet, but I do sense decay in other areas. Even as I write this, I realize that the quality of my writing has fallen off a cliff in the last two years.</p>
  <p>There are many times I want to work on a project or make something the old-fashioned way, but like a bottle in front of a thirsty alcoholic, it is impossible for me to not open ChatGPT. Having only ever coded in the vibe coding era, this issue is compounded for me. The only time I was able to just code from documentation and my own knowledge was when I made the Pong game for the Fallout Pip-Boy. It was a new experience to have to figure things out on my own and not just frustratedly message a chatbot whenever something went wrong but the entire time I just felt slowed down by the handicap.</p>
  <p>While I am slowly losing or just never learning skills that I deemed critical even just two years ago, there is now a whole host of new skills that I am only able to learn due to how powerful LLMs are today. This section was originally going to be named "The Atrophy of Skills" but I have come to believe that the current name is more appropriate.</p>
  <p>For the first time, instead of worrying about how to do a specific task, I now hand the task off and only worry about how to connect the tasks together. In the future, I probably won't even need to worry about that, too. This knowledge of how to effectively leverage these new technologies, AI literacy, is rapidly becoming the most important thing to figure out as I try to establish myself. I say figure out, and not learn, as there is no guidebook or manual on how to leverage AI. The only thing to do is to use it and figure out what it can and can't do, what it responds to and what it doesn't.</p>
  <p>The challenge with developing this so-called AI literacy is that LLMs as they are today are not static whatsoever. Every month a new groundbreaking model exists with new strengths and capabilites and I constantly find myself having to re-evaluate the distribution of responsibilites. I fear that I will fall behind if I look away for a moment, and in a sense I already do feel that way, such as when it comes to agentic AI, for example.</p>
  <p>The most useful observation about LLMs that I have had so far that actually informs my usage is how they do not approach problems like us humans. When tasked with a new problem, the human approach is to build the simplest possible solution and then scaffold upon that. The LLM however, with its bank of pre-trained knowledge, does not prototype and immediately attempts to build a complex, final solution, that inevitably doesn't work in a million different places because it can't deliver that level of complexity without any proper preparation.</p>
  <p>I experienced this firsthand when trying to build this website. I asked ChatGPT to give me a prompt to give Codex to get started and that somehow lead to Codex churning for twenty minutes trying to set up Node.js and TailwindCSS which inevitably didn't work. I had to slam the brakes on the whole operation and force it to make a simple static webpage.</p>
  <p>Though it feels like the LLM has an ego of its own, I suspect this is more to do with the fact that LLMs are trained on the final products and not the intermediate steps that never get published to the internet. But I digress on a topic I'm not qualified to speak more about. Fundamentally, I believe that there is a lot of value human-in-the-loop involvement still has for high level design and architectural decisions, but that necessity does seem to decline every time a new model is released.</p>
  
  <h2>Finding Purpose</h2>
  <p>My entire life I have sought to find my purpose in the impact I can effect in the world. I say "sought" as for many years this was a future objective. I expected to spend my teenage years learning how to do things and then start making an impact once I had the skills and knowledge to do so. Perhaps this was the wrong approach. Perhaps no one ever feels ready, and I should have always been trying to effect an impact, but I again digress.</p>
  <p>With how effective LLMs became last year, 2025 was the first time in my life I felt like I was able to do something that mattered. I found all my challenges approachable in a way they had never felt that way before. Granted, I never approached a real-world coding challenge before vibe coding existed so I truthfully don't know what its like to be "in the weeds", so to speak. I probably never will, and that thought provides me with both relief and fear at the same time.</p>
  <p>If their capabilities continue to grow at the same rate they are now, or god forbid, continue to grow exponentially, I worry how much longer I will be able to be able to do anything meaningful. It's not an outlandish thought that there will be AI architects operating AI agents in a year's time and completely replace the need for human technical guidance. And if that is the case, do my education and skills even provide any purpose anymore? I used to think my greatest asset and transferable skill was my problem solving, but these days I find myself outsourcing even my own thinking more and more. Soon, there may be no reason for me to think at all.</p>
  <p>Over the last few weeks, and indeed, as I write these very words, I have come to realize that I need to reframe my understanding of effecting impact. Its funny that I went through almost the entire internet age without realizing this, but I now understand that focusing on fostering interpersonal connection is now more important than ever. That notion is the primary reason I created this website and blog, a last bastion of defense against AI. The irony of hosting this site on a vibe coded page is not lost on me, but alas, what else am I to do?</p>
  <p>I will use this as a place where I can share my own thoughts, feelings, and ideas; I will share, practice, and preserve what makes me human, what makes me alive. Here, I can create something that is truly my own, and only my own, and share it with those around me, and hopefully have them walk away better for it. This will be a place where, no matter how small, I make <em>my</em> impact.</p>
