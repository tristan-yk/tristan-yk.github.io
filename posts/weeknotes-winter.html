  <p class="lede">A short log from the winter sprint—what shipped, what stalled, and what surprised me.</p>

  <h2>Shipped</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Refined the reading pane so content width is stable when the sidebar opens.</li>
    <li>Added hash routing so URLs survive refresh and the back button works.</li>
    <li>Reworked the article index to be fully keyboard reachable.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Stalled</h2>
  <p>A small “focus” mode prototype needs more testing on mobile; the drawer interaction still competes with the browser gestures.</p>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>Keeping posts as raw HTML keeps the stack thin. The only cost is being disciplined about headings so the generated table of contents stays clean.</p>
